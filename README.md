# Introduction
At some point in the past year, I found myself with the need for a card to give to others to exchange my information with them. Of course, being the type of person who likes to make things, I decided to see if I could create my own card using my lasercutter.
 
It isn’t perfect and it is certainly difficult to make many at a time, but the people I shared this with thought it was cool, so figured I’d upload it here so I can keep track of the things I’ve made and done.

# Making It Your Own
 When you first download the businesscardtemplate.xcs file and open it up with XCS, you will see the following:

 From here, edit the details of the card and move it around as you see fit and make sure the settings for scoring and engraving are the same as above. Then, simply frame it and, once within frame, laser engrave!
# Tips
 It can be hard to align the card precisely. For this reason, I recommend using some scotch tape on either both or one of the sides of the metal card. I didn’t have scotch tape readily available, so I carefully added some electrical tape.
